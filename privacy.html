    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Pellacia Press</strong> (the “App”) operates when you use it to publish content to <em>your own</em> social media accounts, including TikTok. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Pellacia Press application.</p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>Pellacia Press does not collect, store, or sell any personal information. The App is designed exclusively for posting content to social media accounts that you own and authorize. It only processes the content you choose to publish and temporary technical information (such as access tokens) required to connect to your own accounts via the TikTok API.</p>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <p>Any information accessed through the TikTok API is used solely to enable posting content to your own TikTok account. No user profiling, advertising, or data resale occurs.</p>

    <h2>Data storage and sharing</h2>
    <p>Pellacia Press does not permanently store any data from TikTok or elsewhere. Temporary tokens needed for authentication and posting are used only during your session and not retained. No data is shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Your rights and contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or Pellacia Press, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pellacia.com">contact@pellacia.com</a>.</p>
